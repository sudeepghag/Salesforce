### Apex Best Practices
(Link)[https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Apex_Code_Best_Practices]

### Process Builder vs. Workflow
* Create a record of any object type
* Update any related record—not just the record or its parent
* Use a quick action to create a record, update a record, or log a call
* Invoke a process from another process
* Launch a flow—you can’t schedule this action with workflow
* Send an email
* Post to Chatter
* Submit a record for approval

* Workflow rules – An automation tool that can evaluate an argument, and kick off an automation function. These functions can include a field update, sending an email message, creating a task, or sending an outbound message. A workflow can only evaluate a single criteria before it either triggers the automation or does not.
